# Step 5B

- The vote calculations are not correct when we get to the reward phase.

I need you to very carefully analyse the files and find the cause for this


- The fact that we have 3 cats in the pictures is fine, it makes the testing easier
- Issue 1 -> Image 1: How the back arrow and timer CURRENTLY look like, image 2: How the back arrow and timer SHOULD look like
  - The timer and countdown seconds are not positioned well
  - Missing text "Waiting for all players to vote . . ."
  - When timer reaches 10 - the numbers should become red, and slightly bigger
- Issue 2 -> Image 3: How the self vote warning message CURRENTLY look like, image 2: How the self vote warning message SHOULD look like
  - The self vote warning should only appear as text, not in a white box with an outline
  - The self vote warning should be on the right side of our cream stages base, not hidden behind it
  - The self vote warning's container should be be more vertical
- Issue 3 -> Image 5: How the rewards phase CURRENTLY look like, image 2: How the rewards phase SHOULD look like
  - In the rewards phase we don't need the walkway stage image any more
  - In the rewards phase we don't need the "X votes =", only "Y coins" in white with no outline


# Step 6A

- The fact that we have 3 cats in the pictures is fine, it makes the testing easier
- Image 1: How the rewards phase CURRENTLY look like, image 2: How the rewards phase SHOULD look like
  - In the rewards phase we need to have for each stage - a brown box
  - In the brown box we need - coin amount in white text, cat name in black text, and smaller username in black text
  - (The text itself (The coins text, the cat name and the usernames are correct) and the sizing is good right now)
  - Right now (in rewards phase) :
    - The coin text needs to be a tad bit higher
    - The cat name's needs to be properly positioned between the 2 texts.

Split the problem into simple small sub-steps and fix them all, but tackle carefully one at a time
