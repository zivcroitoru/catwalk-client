I have a project I'm working on, and one of the requirements is for the screen to be relatively responsive to various computer screen sizes (laptops and desktops, but no need whatsoever for phones and tablets).
I've added to my css `@media` parts at the end as to take care of different general sizes. I still have some way to go, but I think it's a good start.
Tell me your thought and help me right a prompt for claud with a plan with sub steps.

---------


**Help me make my fashion show interface relatively responsive for desktop/laptop screens (no need for mobile, ultrawide monitors, etc). Here's my current approach and what I need to improve:**

**CURRENT STATE:**
- I have basic media queries scaling `.cat-display` by height breakpoints
- Most dimensions use CSS custom properties but are still fixed pixel values
- Layout works on my development screen but needs adaptation for various desktop sizes

**GOALS:**
1. **Responsive scaling system** that works smoothly across desktop screen sizes (1366x768 to 4K)
2. **Proportional scaling** of all UI elements, not just the cat display
3. **Flexible layout** that maintains visual hierarchy and readability
4. **Performance optimization** for different screen densities

**SPECIFIC AREAS TO ADDRESS:**

**Sub-step 1: Comprehensive Breakpoint Strategy**
- Analyze current breakpoints (600px, 900px, 1300px height) and optimize
- Add width-based breakpoints for ultrawide monitors
- Create a scaling system that considers both width AND height
- Handle edge cases like very wide but short screens

**Sub-step 2: Typography & UI Element Scaling**
- Scale fonts proportionally with screen size while maintaining readability
- Ensure buttons, timer, and warning messages scale appropriately
- Make spacing variables more flexible (convert some px to rem/em/vw/vh)
- Optimize the Jersey 10 font rendering at different scales

**Sub-step 3: Layout Container Optimization**
- Review the main game area positioning and sizing
- Optimize the stage bases layout for different aspect ratios  
- Ensure proper spacing between elements at all scales
- Handle the fixed 1050px width of `.cat-display` more flexibly

**Sub-step 4: Interactive Element Responsiveness**
- Ensure click targets remain appropriately sized across scales
- Optimize hover effects and animations for different screen sizes
- Make sure the exit dialog scales properly
- Verify timer and progress elements remain readable

**Sub-step 5: Performance & Polish**
- Minimize layout shifts during scaling
- Optimize CSS for different pixel densities
- Test the scaling animations work smoothly at different sizes
- Remove debug background colors and finalize the system

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- Must maintain the pixel art aesthetic and sharp rendering
- Keep the current color scheme and design language
- Preserve all interactive functionality
- No need for mobile/tablet support

**OUTPUT REQUESTED:**
- Updated CSS with improved media queries and flexible units
- Explanation of the scaling strategy chosen
- Recommendations for testing across different screen sizes
- Any JavaScript adjustments needed for responsive behavior

Please provide a systematic approach with code examples for each sub-step, focusing on creating a robust scaling system that maintains the game's visual quality across desktop screen sizes.
